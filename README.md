# Data Preparation 1

Prepare a script-document in `Quarto` format that:

1. For a specified directory and extension, reads all tables and merges them into one. Tables are saved in `csv` format, even though they might not have extensions indicating this. The number of files can vary.
2. Conducts a preliminary data review including:
   1. The number of data entries.
   2. Data types.
   3. The number of distinct values for each variable. If this number is less than a specified optional value, these values should be presented.
3. Includes a chapter explaining why preliminary data review is important.

Remember to:

1. Create a new branch before starting work.
2. Manage 'pull request' and subsequent discussion.
3. The document should include a title, author, and the date-time of the report preparation.
4. All stages should be clearly described.
5. The dynamic document should be robust against possible errors.

*Note.* I am interested in any original ideas that enrich the script-document.
